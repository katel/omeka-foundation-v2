## Omeka-foundation theme v2

A very basic Omeka port of the Zurb Foundation framework v2.2.1. Foundation is based around The Grid; a twelve-column, semi-liquid layout. Find out more at: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/f2/

Foundation 3 does not support IE7 so the Omeka Foundation theme using Version 2.2.1 has been archived here for users who need to provide IE7 support. Check browser and device support online at: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/support.php
